---------------------------

I am an Embedded Software Developer who loves C/C++, Python, and Linux, also with which how amazing tangible things can be made. Started the journey by being fascinated by robots to making medical devices. I work with Flutter as a hobby and building IoT applications to connect the hardware built with STM32 to have a full-fledged application.
